        <h1>New World</h1>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/31Ddpdx.jpg" alt="Story Image">

        <p>The wind here moves softly—slow and gentle, like a breath from the earth itself. It carries the scent of wild grass and distant rain, sometimes catching Souta off guard with a sudden gust that makes his chest ache. He can’t explain why. Just… something about it feels like the past.</p>
        <p>The hills roll endlessly, green and alive, dotted with wildflowers and moss-covered stones. The land feels untouched—open and quiet, as if it’s been waiting for someone to notice.</p>
       <p>He doesn’t know how he got here.</p>
       <p>There was a world before this one. He knows that much. But it’s foggy. His memories are fragmented, like burned paper—edges blackened, pieces missing.</p>
        <p>He remembers systems. Rules that crushed people instead of helping them. Crowded rooms filled with people screaming, or not speaking at all. Cold light. Sharp voices. Empty promises.</p>
        <p>He remembers loss, too. Faces without names. Moments where everything fell apart, and no one came to help. Sometimes the memories come as flashes—too fast, too raw. Other times, they stay like a heaviness in his chest.<p/>
        <p>The only things that remain clear are the feelings:</p>
       <p> Rage. Grief. Fear. Shame. Guilt.<p/>
      <p>He left that world behind. Or maybe he ran. He’s wasn't sure.<p/>
        <p>All he knows is—this place is quiet. The wind doesn’t scream here. The silence isn’t dangerous.<br>
      For now.</p>

       <p>There was a place up in the hills—a forgotten cabin, surrounded by long grass and endless sky. Souta had found it by chance, tucked into the slope like a secret. Weathered wood. Moss creeping along the base. The roof sagged slightly, but it held. It looked like someone had once meant to return… but never did.</p>
       <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9ABOkx.jpg" alt="A colorful sky" style="width:200px; height:auto; margin-right:15px;">
</div>
       <p>The inside smelled of dust and old air. The floor creaked beneath his steps, every sound swallowed by silence. Cobwebs gathered in the corners. A few shelves still clung to the walls, empty but for a cracked jar and a single chipped cup. In the fireplace, cold ash sat undisturbed. It hadn’t known fire in years.</p>
        <p>There was no bed, no warmth, no comfort. But it was enough.</p>
        <p>It felt untouched. Forgotten.</p>
       <p> Souta stayed for a while. He didn't know how long—time didn’t matter here. The silence was heavy, but not cruel. He watched the wind play through the grass outside. Let the sun warm his face. Sometimes he sat by the empty hearth, not trying to light it—just being near it, as if it still remembered what warmth felt like.</p>
        <p>He loved that place. It felt like a gentle pause. A breath.</p>
       <p>But deep down, he knew it wasn’t where the journey ended.</p>
       <p> It was where it had to begin.</p>
       <p> So one morning, with aching steps and a quiet resolve, he left it behind.</p>

 <p>The days after the cabin were quiet and unfamiliar. He walked until his legs ached, the hills rolling gently beneath the soles of his worn boots.</p>
       <p> He found a river on the second day. The water was cold and clear, glittering in the sunlight. He caught a few small fish with his hands—clumsy, slow—but it was enough. Making fire was harder. It took him hours to get it going, sparks dying in the wind, fingers scraped and stiff. But eventually, it burned. The smoke rose into the sky like a signal to no one.</p>
        <p>That night, he slept in an open field, the grass soft beneath him. The sky above was scattered with stars—too many to count, too beautiful to look away from. There was no roof, no walls, no safety. But there was something else—something better.</p>
        Freedom.
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BewgjBt.jpg" alt="A colorful sky" style="width:200px; height:auto; margin-right:15px;">
  <p>The kind that hurt a little.<br>
        He watched the stars until his eyes grew heavy, the breeze brushing gently against his face, and he drifted to sleep with the night sky above him.</p></div>
<p>Souta had been walking for days, letting the landscape carry him wherever it wanted. He didn’t know what he was searching for. Maybe just somewhere he could breathe.</p>

<p>Then he saw it—nestled between two hills, quiet and almost hidden. A village. Thistledown.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SnYTBAP.jpg" alt="A colorful sky" style="width:200px; height:auto; margin-right:15px;">
</div>
<p>It was small—maybe thirty homes at most—tucked into the valley like it had always been there. Thin trails of smoke drifted from chimneys. Children’s laughter echoed from somewhere near the fields. There were chickens, gardens, mossy fences, worn paths. Nothing loud. Nothing fast.</p>

<p>It felt like a breath the world had been holding.</p>

<p>He didn’t hesitate. His feet carried him forward like they knew the way.</p>

<p>When he arrived, no one questioned him. The villagers didn’t ask where he came from, or why he looked like he’d been through hell. They just offered him kindness.</p>

<p>A woman with dirt-stained hands—Mara, the gardener—offered him water and a place to sit.</p>
<p>“You look like you’ve walked through a few storms,” she said, matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>Souta flinched at the kindness. His first instinct was to pull away. Kindness had always come with a price where he came from. But Mara didn’t ask for anything. She just poured him tea from a chipped pot and kept weeding her carrots.</p>

<p>He stayed.</p>

<p>Mara, trimming herbs outside her home, glanced up at him.</p>
<p>“You’ve got shadows in your eyes, boy. That’s alright. Everyone brings something with them when they come here. The trick is learning how to carry it.”</p>

<p>Bren, the baker, tossing flour across a board, said,</p>
<p>“Not asking where you’re from. You don’t ask the sky where the wind’s been. Just glad it blew you here.”</p>

<p>Tolin, the old shoemaker, with cracked hands and slow speech, said,</p>
<p>“People in the capital wear polished boots. Look perfect on the outside, rotten on the in. You? Your shoes are falling apart, but your eyes tell the truth.”</p>

<p>A group of kids often gathered by the stream, full of noise and wonder. They waved at Souta when they saw him pass.</p>

<p>Nim, the fearless one, ran up to him one day.</p>

<p>“You’re really quiet,” she said, tilting her head. “Do you have secrets?”</p>

<p>Souta hesitated. “Maybe.”</p>

<p>She grinned. “That’s okay. I do too.”</p>

<p>Another boy, Rey, yelled from across the stream:</p>

<p>“We found a door in the woods! It was real! Nim touched it!”</p>

<p>“It glowed,” Nim said proudly. “Like it was humming. Like… a song only you could hear.”</p>

<p>Souta said nothing. But something in his chest stirred. Not fear. Not quite hope. Just… something old.</p>

<p>The village, Thistledown, felt like an anchor in his chaotic mind—a place where he could pause and regain his footing. The more time Souta spent here, the more he felt like it was meant to be. This was the moment to start his journey, not the end of it. Something bigger was waiting out there. And maybe, just maybe, Thistledown was the place where it all began.</p>
<p>The kids led Souta through the woods, their laughter and chatter bouncing off the trees. Nim marched at the front, acting like a seasoned explorer, while Rey trailed behind, swinging a stick at anything that crossed his path.
</p>
<p>When they reached the place, Souta finally saw it — a weathered old door, half-swallowed by earth, grass, and creeping vines. The wood was gray and splintered, so worn it looked like it belonged to the ground more than any house or room. It had no frame, no hinges in sight — just the door, standing alone against the earth, like it was never meant to be found.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2RY8n7L.jpg" alt="A colorful sky" style="width:200px; height:auto; margin-right:15px;">
</div>
<p>For a moment, Souta just stared. Something about it made his chest tighten. Carefully, he stepped closer and brushed his fingers against the cool vine-covered surface. He found a small cracked corner where the wood had split away, and without thinking, he leaned in, peeking through the gap.
</p>
<p>Inside, it wasn’t empty.</p>
<p>The space beyond the door stretched into deep darkness — but faintly, scattered like stars in the night, were soft glows. Not too bright, not too dim. They almost looked alive. The air seeping out from the crack was cool, carrying a strange weight that he couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>Souta pulled back slightly, his gaze lingering.
“Maybe we should leave it the way it is... for now,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>The kids exchanged glances, but none of them argued. Somehow, they understood.</p>
<p>As they walked back to the village, the mood lightened again, the trees swaying gently overhead.</p>
<p>Nim skipped beside him, hands behind her head.
“So, what adventure rank are you?” she asked suddenly.
</p>
<p>Souta blinked. “Adventure... rank?”</p>
<p>Nim tilted her head. “You know, like bronze, silver, gold! Adventurers get ranked! You’re traveling, right? You look like one.”</p>
<p>Rey chimed in from behind. “You’ve fought monsters, haven’t you? Big ones? With fangs and claws and everything?”
</p>
<p>Souta paused. “I... don’t know what you mean. I’m not an adventurer.”</p>
<p>The kids stopped mid-step, looking at him like he’d just told them the sky wasn’t real.
</p>
<p>You’re not!?” Nim’s voice cracked with surprise. “But... you walk around like one!”
</p>
<p>Rey puffed out his chest. “Adventurers are like heroes! They go places, fight bad monsters, and help people!”</p>
<p>Another boy, Tallo, crossed his arms.
“My mom said my dad was a Knight. He fought monsters to protect the village.”</p>
<p>Yeah, well — I’m gonna be one too!” Rey shot back. “I’ll be stronger than you!”</p>
<p>Tallo smirked. “Not a chance.”</p>
<p>The two boys kept trading playful jabs, both puffed up like tiny roosters, while Nim walked quietly beside Souta, glancing at him sideways.
</p>
<p>
“You could be either,” she said softly. “But you look more like someone who makes their own rules.”</p>
<p>Souta didn’t answer, only let out a small, quiet chuckle.<br>
For the first time in a long while, the warmth in his chest wasn’t from the sun.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the village, the sun was already starting to slip behind the hills. The sky was painted in soft orange and fading blue, and the first stars blinked faintly through the quiet evening air.</p>
<p>The kids ran ahead as the village lights flickered to life, and soon enough, a few parents were waiting at the worn old fences, their faces a mix of relief and quiet scolding.
</p>
<p>“I told you not to go there,” one mother said, ruffling her son’s hair, her voice more tired than angry.</p>
<p>“You kids shouldn’t wander too deep into the woods,” another father muttered, kneeling to check if his daughter had scraped her knees.</p>
<p>But none of them raised their voices. Just the kind of worry that came from love, not fear. Souta stood at the edge of it all, watching the scene, not sure whether he belonged in it or not.
</p>
<p>Later that night, as the village settled into the calm hum of evening, a knock came at the door of the small shed Mara had offered him to sleep in. When he opened it, it was Tallo — the boy who had mentioned his father was a Knight</p>
<p>“My dad says you should come eat with us,” Tallo said, grinning a little. “He doesn’t like seeing people eat alone.”</p>
<p>Souta followed him through the quiet village lanes until they reached a small house, built strong but plain. The smell of stew and baked bread filled the air as soon as the door opened.
</p>
<p>Tallo’s father — a broad-shouldered man with a fading scar on his cheek and hands rough like tree bark — gave Souta a nod as he stepped inside. His name was Garven.
</p>
<p>They ate simple, filling food. No one asked heavy questions. When the plates were mostly empty and the room settled into that soft quiet that comes after a meal, Garven finally spoke.
</p>
<p>“You’ve got the look of someone who's walked more roads than most men twice your age,” he said, not as a question but a fact. “I was a Knight once. Long time ago.”</p>
<p>Souta glanced at him but didn’t speak.
</p>
<p>“Knighthood isn’t what the kids believe it is,” Garven continued. “It’s not just honor and steel. Sometimes it’s doing things you don’t want to. Orders you don’t agree with. When I hung up the sword, it wasn’t because I was tired of fighting monsters. It was the other kind of monsters that wore human faces that broke me.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the room sat in silence, only the faint crackle of the hearth filling the space.</p>
<p>“You’ll learn,” Garven said, leaning back in his chair. “Out there, the world’s wide and wild. Not everything’s black and white. Some things, you can only understand once you stand in front of them.”</p>
<p>He pushed a small loaf of bread toward Souta, like an unspoken gesture of trust.</p>

<p>“Wherever you go next, remember this much — the world doesn’t owe you kindness. But it doesn’t owe you cruelty, either. The only thing that matters is what you carry inside when you face it.”</p>

<p>Souta didn’t reply. But for the first time in a long while, the silence around him didn’t feel empty.</p>
<p>When dinner was finished and the plates were cleared, Souta stood to leave. Before stepping out the door, he paused for a moment and gave a quiet, almost awkward nod.</p>

<p>“…Thank you. For the meal. And… for the kindness.”</p>

<p>Garven only gave him a small nod in return. “The road’s long, boy. Everyone needs a place to sit now and then. Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>The night air was cool as Souta walked back through the village. The homes glowed faintly from their windows, and the streets were quiet, but the world around him wasn’t empty.</p>

<p>Tiny flickers of light blinked along the fields and bushes — fireflies, floating slowly through the tall grass like drifting stars. Above him, the sky stretched wide and deep, the moon bright and full, surrounded by a sea of sharp, clear stars. The soft, steady chorus of night insects filled the air, not loud, not quiet — just there, like the world was humming to itself.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LLa423q.jpg" alt="A colorful sky" style="width:200px; height:auto; margin-right:15px;">
</div>

<p>Souta paused for a moment at the edge of the field and sat down, letting the grass press against his palms. The world felt big. Bigger than anything he’d let himself think about before.</p>

<p>When he finally lay down in his small bed, the words Garven had spoken drifted back into his thoughts, quiet but sharp. The outside world. Roads he hadn’t walked yet. Faces he hadn’t met. Dangers. Wonders. And something else too — the unknown.</p>

<p>For the first time, he wondered about himself.</p>

<p>Why was he here?<br>
What was he supposed to do?<br>
Did he have anyone waiting for him, out there?<br>
Or was this world all he had now?</p>

<p>The questions felt heavy, and a small part of him felt afraid. The village was kind, quiet, but he knew deep down that he couldn’t stay here forever. There was more waiting for him. And he couldn’t run from it.</p>

<p>If this was a second chance — if the world had given him this quiet, gentle moment — he couldn’t waste it.</p>

<p>I can’t stay the same, he thought, staring at the wooden ceiling.<br>
I have to change.<br>
No one else will do it for me.</p>

<p>With that small spark of quiet resolve sitting in his chest, Souta finally let his eyes close. The wind whispered gently against the walls, the stars glowed silently beyond the roof, and sleep came easier than it had in a long, long time.</p>
<p>The morning sun hung steady overhead as Souta stood near Garven’s house, watching the Knight sharpen his blade. The old man didn’t look up, just kept running the whetstone along the steel, slow and even.</p>

<p>After a while, Souta spoke.<br>
“…Can you teach me how to fight?”</p>

<p>Garven paused, finally lifting his eyes. He sized Souta up, like measuring a piece of wood before cutting it.</p>

<p>“You ever held a sword before?”
Souta shook his head.
Garven snorted quietly. “Didn’t think so.”</p>

<p>He stood, stretching his back with a faint crack. “Follow me.”</p>

<p>They stepped around the back of the house, to a bare patch of earth where the grass had long been beaten down by practice. Garven walked over to a wooden rack and pulled down a battered training sword. He tossed it to Souta.</p>

<p>“Hold it. Let me see.”</p>

<p>Souta gripped the sword. It felt awkward, heavier than it looked.</p>

<p>“You hold it like that, you’ll lose your hand before the fight even starts,” Garven said, flat as ever. “First lesson’s simple: don’t get yourself killed the second you draw.”</p>

<p>He stepped into position, feet planted solid in the dirt. “Sword’s not about swinging harder. It’s about standing steady. You lose your footing, you lose the fight. Doesn’t matter who’s stronger.”</p>

<p>The day dragged on and each swing Souta made earned a correction. His arms burned, his grip slipped, and every muscle felt too slow. Garven wasn’t cruel, but he wasn’t gentle either — just clear and sharp, like the blade he’d been sharpening.</p>

<p>When the sun dipped low and the dirt was scuffed from hours of practice, Souta’s body was ready to give out.</p>

<p>Garven picked up the training sword from him. “You’re sloppy. But I’ve seen worse.”</p>

<p>Souta wiped the sweat from his face, breathing hard. “I’ll come back tomorrow.”<p>

<p>The old Knight nodded once, already turning away.</p>
<p>“Do that. World’s not going to wait for you to be ready.”</p>
